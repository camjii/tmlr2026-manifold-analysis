This is the official repository of the paper "_Hypothesis-Driven Feature Manifold Analysis in LLMs via Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling_" published in TMLR. It contains our implementation of Supervised Multidimensional Scaling (SMDS), as well as the scripts necessary to record activations, score different manifolds, and some utilities to plot the results.

>__NOTE:__ We also offer a [stand-alone implementation of SMDS](https://github.com/UKPLab/supervised-multidimensional-scaling)!

><summary> <b>Abstract</b> </summary>
>The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized, multidimensional manifolds. Prior work has largely focused on identifying specific geometries for individual features, limiting its ability to generalize. We introduce Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method for evaluating and comparing competing feature manifold hypotheses. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning as a case study and find that different features instantiate distinct geometric structures, including circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals several consistent characteristics of these structures: they reflect the semantic properties of the concepts they represent, remain stable across model families and sizes, actively support reasoning, and dynamically reshape in response to contextual changes. Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds, supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform structured representations.

## Getting Started

Simply create a conda environment and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate shape-happens
  ```

## Usage

We offer scripts to automatically record activations, score different hypothesis manifolds, and run interventions. First, activations for a given model on a given dataset should be recorded. Then, after the activations have been stored on disk, scores and interventions can be performed.

```bash
python record_activations.py --config <filename> 
```

- `--config <filename>`: specifies the location of a config file listing all configurations to evaluate and record. See `configs/activations.yaml` for an example;

```bash
python compute_scores.py --config <filename> 
```

- `--config <filename>`: specifies the location of a config file listing all manifold configurations to score. See `configs/scoring.yaml` for an example;
- `--save_path <filename>`: Optional. Specifies a filename where the summary scores are stored. The default path is `results/scores/combined_scores.csv`;
- `--overwrite`: Optional. If passed, overwrites existing scoring results. All manifold scores are stored in `results/scores`;

```bash
python record_interventions.py --config <filename> 
```

- `--config <filename>`: specifies the location of a config file listing all configurations to evaluate and record. See `configs/interventions.yaml` for an example;
